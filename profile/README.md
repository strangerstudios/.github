# Our Open Source Solutions

We do things [The WordPress Way](https://therealjasoncoleman.com/2022/04/26/the-wordpress-way/).

1. **We think using the GPL license will result in the best code.**
2. WordPress uses the GPL license, and Matt Mullenweg and the other WordPress leaders encourage and expect plugins to be GPL.

All of our code is here on GitHub. We have embraced the GPL and try to not only live up to the law of the license but the spirit of it as well. This means making our code accessible to everyone. Check out our respositories here on Github, including:

- [Paid Memberships Pro](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com), a WordPress membership plugin to restrict access to content and charge recurring subscriptions using Stripe, PayPal, and more.
- [Sitewide Sales](https://sitewidesales.com/), a plugin to run Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or other flash sales on your WordPress-powered eCommerce or membership site with WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, and Paid Memberships Pro.

Our full collection of over 150 open source solutions are available on GitHub.

# Our Core Values

Our core values exemplify the people we enjoy working with. They exemplify the people we enjoy being. We hire based on these core values. Our employee review process focuses on these core values.

Our core values help us to make decisions about our work. When we are stuck between two alternative courses of action, the option that is most inline with our core values is the one we should take.

- We do purposeful work.
- We take responsibility for our own work.
- We have respect for each other and our customers.
- We are all human.
- We are committed to open source and "the WordPress way".

# How We Use GitHub

Code is a huge part of what we do. Every feature, menu option, checkbox, and word in our software has been strategically added with code.

However, it takes a lot of work to store, maintain, and contribute to our code base. We use GitHub to open source our plugins and ever-growing library of Add Ons and code recipes. As an external collaborator, here is how we welcome your contributions to our software:

- We encourage and welcome any contribution to our code. If you find a bug, report it in an Issue for that plugin's GitHub repository.
- Anyone from inside or outside our team can submit a potential code change or 'Pull Request'. Once submitted, the repository owners review these code changes, post comments, suggest changes, then merge or reject them.
- If you're not a developer, you can still get involved by contributing a translation through GitHub or directly to a plugin through GlotPress on WordPress.org.
